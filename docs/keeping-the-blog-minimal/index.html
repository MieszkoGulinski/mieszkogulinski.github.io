Let's be considerate about people using low end devices and using a mobile network with data limits. I don't really want to squeeze every last byte or limit myself to a specific max size, but to be reasonably minimal, with compromises if necessary.</p><h2>Scripts</h2><p>A significant port of bloat <a href="https://linustechtips.com/main/topic/931387-gdpr-brings-massive-speed-improvement-to-websites/">comes from various analytics scripts</a>. Huge amount of various tracking scripts will make your page sluggish, and will scare off your users. Use them really, really sparingly, if at all.</p><h2>Small CSS</h2><p>My blog is inspired by <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/">this website</a>, where the author decided to use only 7 CSS declarations while keeping the page look reasonably good.</p><p>I didn't limit myself to a specific size in kB, or specific number of lines, just aiming to keeping the styles small, simple and without unnecessary elements. That's why I didn't use any CSS framework and wrote everything from scratch. I also used system font, trying to make the text legible by setting font size to value I find personally easiest to read.</p><p>Blogs often have minimal style - <a href="https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection/node-js-can-http-2-push-b491894e1bb1">the ones</a> <a href="https://medium.com/squad-engineering/blazingly-fast-querying-on-huge-tables-by-avoiding-joins-5be0fca2f523">hosted on Medium</a> can be good examples, as well as <a href="https://rauchg.com/2014/7-principles-of-rich-web-applications">many</a> <a href="https://dave.cheney.net/2019/07/09/clear-is-better-than-clever">others</a>. But it doesn't really mean that the download size is small. After loading <a href="https://medium.com/@luke_73359/getting-started-with-icestorm-verilog-on-the-ice40hx1k-fpga-cbc71ad3947d">this Medium article</a> - with two images in the post body and no lead image - developer tools show <code>2.5 MB transferred</code> and <code>5.0 MB resources</code>. Quite bad, isn't it? On contrary, <a href="https://dave.cheney.net/2018/07/12/slices-from-the-ground-up">this beautifully designed blog</a> shows <code>306 kB transferred</code> and <code>693 kB resources</code>. Much better, but it doesn't satisfy me.</p><p>I wanted styles to be small enough, so that they can be loaded as inline <code>&lt;style></code> tag, instead of a separate file, saving a single HTTP request. Maybe except code highlighting, but it can be loaded later and nothing bad should happen.</p><p>Harder to maintain? Yes, but the styles are small enough so it won't be a problem, and there's no risk of a customer asking me to change text color or font size somewhere.</p><p>An example of a really cool site that uses styling very sparingly is <a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html">Astronomy Picture of the Day</a>. It looks like it didn't change since its start in 1990s, but... it just works. It's functional.</p><h2>Static generation</h2><p>Static generation means that each page - in case of blog, these will be index, article etc. - is pre-rendered and then served as a static HTML file. This is in contrast to dynamic templates, rendered on each page load.</p><p>From many static page generators, I use <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a>. There are many more static page generators, such as <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/">Gatsby</a> or <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a> can generate pages statically or dynamically (on each request). A large list of static page generators is available <a href="https://jamstack.org/generators/">here</a>.</p><p>I used Eleventy because it's a simple tool with easy setup. Even though my job is a React developer, and I'm extremely familiar with this library, I didn't use React-based page generators (Next.js, Gatsby) because they're an overkill for a very simple blog.</p><h2>Images</h2><p>At first, not every post needs a lead photo. If an image doesn't add anything to the article content, why insert it at all? I don't need to add a stock photo of a computer. Instead, I think it's better to find an image that gives some useful information to the reader - if it's about software, it can be a screenshot, in other subjects it can be an infographics, or photo of the specific item the article is about.</p><p>Posting code as a screenshot, <a href="https://carbon.now.sh/">or a screenshot-like image</a>, has a risk that font size on the image mismatches font size of the rest of the article, making the article harder to read.</p><p>What about image size? In this very blog, the largest possible content width, in CSS pixels, is 710 px. So it's no use having larger photos - unless I want to show a great looking photo with lots of details and make it look perfect on high-DPI screens.</p><h2>Does it really help the end user?</h2><p>Many of the things really do, also I do them for my own fun. Worth it? Definitely yes.</p><a href="/">Go back to home page</a></article><footer><div class="footer-content"><a href="https://www.radcode.co/">Do you need an app?</a></div></footer></body></html>
